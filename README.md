### Coursework 1 for Tartu University course LOTI.05.091

Videos are in .webm format. The name of the file gives a brief idea of what is being demostrated in the video. The code that I altered has been uploaded. To run the potential field code, copy the contents of potential_field (copy).py into one's local ROS environment's potential_field.py file and run 'roslaunch potential_field potential_field.launch'. To the same for CBF - copy the contents of cbf.py and run 'roslaunch potential_field potential_field.launch'.
